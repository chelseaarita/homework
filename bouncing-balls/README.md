# Bouncing Balls
This mini project was done as a guided class activity and took approximately four hours from 9:30am to about 4pm with 2 hours of breaks. We took Mozilla Developer Network's [Objects building practice](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice) called "bouncing balls". 

## What I learned
We are currently learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). One of things I learned in this project was becoming more familiar with objects, how they work, and seeing how interactive JavaScript can be. I had a lot of fun with this project. I wouldn't say it was easy but by becoming more familiar with the syntax, logic, and structure, it was a great project for repetitiveness and muscle memory. 

I'm still fascinated by the fact you can write so many lines of code and come up with something like this project. It's really cool.
